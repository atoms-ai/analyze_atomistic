# FORTRAN
Fortran codes for analysis of MD simulations

Mostly used for meshing the paritcle-substrate simulation setup to compute pressure, temperature and other thermodyanmic properties

Dimensional analysis - Computes a real time particle height and width during deformation
Interface_PT - Computes the local pressure and temperatures for a thin region (user defined) at the particle/substrate interface
